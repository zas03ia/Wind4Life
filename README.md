# Overview

Wind4Life is a non-profit organization providing real-time wind data around the world.

For this exercise, we would like you to review and work from this existing codebase. The purpose of the exercise is to understand how you approach an unfamiliar application, how you make a scoped change in an existing system, and how you reason about the technical future of a product.

This particular codebase is a **Laravel 11** port of the Wind4Life backend. It uses Sanctum for API authentication, PostgreSQL for storage, Redis for caching, and Pest for the test suite — orchestrated locally with Laravel Sail.

# Exercise

This exercise has two parts.

## Part 1 — Implement a small feature

We would like you to add an **export capability** to the application.

The export should support:

- JSON
- CSV

We are intentionally leaving this request somewhat open-ended. Part of the exercise is to see how you interpret the requirement, how you navigate the existing Laravel application, and how you make pragmatic implementation choices within the current structure of the project.

We are not looking for a perfect or exhaustive solution. We are more interested in:

- how you understand the codebase,
- where you decide to introduce the change,
- how you scope the work,
- how you justify your choices,
- and how you validate the implementation.

Please include:

- your code changes,
- any tests you consider appropriate,
- and any brief notes you feel are useful to explain your approach.

## How to submit

Fork this repo, work on a branch in your fork, and open the PR **inside your own fork** (your branch into your fork's `main`) — not against this repo. Share the PR link as your deliverable.

## Part 2 — Analyze / audit the repository

Please review the repository as if you had just inherited this application and were responsible for helping guide its future.

In the follow-up interview, we will discuss your perspective on topics such as:

- architecture,
- maintainability,
- code quality,
- security,
- scalability,
- developer experience,
- future product and platform evolution.

You do **not** need to prepare a formal written audit. Personal notes are sufficient if they help structure your thinking.

What matters most is your ability to discuss the system clearly, concretely, and thoughtfully.

# Follow-up interview

After the exercise, you will have a follow-up discussion with engineers from our team.

This conversation may cover:

- your implementation choices,
- your understanding of the repository,
- your technical assessment of the codebase,
- security and architectural considerations,
- tradeoffs you identified,
- how you would evolve the application over time,
- how you would think about scaling and supporting future features.

The objective is not only to review the code you produced, but also to understand how you analyze an existing system, make engineering decisions, and communicate your reasoning.

# Expectations

We are not looking for a large redesign or an overengineered solution.

We encourage you to:

- keep the implementation focused,
- make reasonable assumptions,
- work with the existing structure of the project,
- and be ready to explain your decisions and tradeoffs.

A simple, well-judged solution is generally stronger than a broad or overly ambitious one.

# Deliverables

Please share:

- a link to the Pull Request in your fork (see [How to submit](#how-to-submit)),
- your implementation,
- your tests,
- and any notes you would like to bring into the discussion.

# The application

The currently implemented features:

- Users can manage anemometers (CRUD).
- Users can submit wind speed readings (in knots) for a given anemometer at a given time.
- A paginated endpoint listing anemometers with their 5 latest readings and weekly / daily average speeds.
- Users can see the daily / weekly mean wind speed for each anemometer.
- Users can list all paginated readings for a given anemometer.
- Users can filter anemometer readings by a given set of tags.
- Authentication (via Sanctum personal access tokens) is required to call the API.

# Getting started

## Installing dependencies

You're going to need [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) to run this project. The stack is orchestrated with [Laravel Sail](https://laravel.com/docs/11.x/sail).

We recommend you install [go-task](https://taskfile.dev/installation/) to run the project's tasks — if you'd rather not, take a look at `taskfile.yml` and run the underlying commands yourself.

The instructions below assume macOS. On Linux, replace the `brew` commands with your package manager.

At project root, run:

```bash
task install-deps
```

This installs composer dependencies (inside a one-shot Docker container, so you don't need PHP locally), creates `.env` from `.env.example`, generates an `APP_KEY`, and sets up `pre-commit`.

## Tasks

These tasks are useful for running the project and dev environment utilities.

### List all "important" tasks:

```bash
task
```

**Note**: This won't list **all** tasks, just the ones with a description that we deem interesting for an external dev. Take a look at `taskfile.yml` for the full set.

-----------------------------------------------------------

### Initialize the app

Idempotent task that builds the image, brings the stack up, runs migrations, and seeds data:

```bash
task init-app
```

**Note**: Resets all data and tables. You'll end up with one seeded user and 50 anemometers, each with 100 readings. If you want to keep existing data, use `task up` instead.

Open [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000/) in your browser to land on the frontpage.

This runs the stack in detached mode (needed for the data initialization step). For logs use `task up` or `task logs` afterwards.

Login with the seeded admin account:

- Username: `admin`
- Password: `admin`

-----------------------------------------------------------

### Reset DB

Wipe all tables and re-run migrations, useful for a clean DB state:

```bash
task reset-db
```

-----------------------------------------------------------

### Generate anemometers

Create anemometers with a set of readings:

```bash
task create_anemometers -- num_of_anemometers num_of_readings_per_anemometer num_tags_per_reading
# ex: task create_anemometers -- 50 100 2
```

-----------------------------------------------------------

### Running tests

```bash
task tests
```

-----------------------------------------------------------

### Any artisan management command

```bash
task manage -- <command>
# ex: task manage -- route:list
```

-----------------------------------------------------------

### Start / stop the stack

```bash
task up     # Start the Sail stack (attach to logs)
task down   # Stop and remove the Sail containers
task logs   # Tail the Sail logs
task bash   # Open a shell inside the app container
```
