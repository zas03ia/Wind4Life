 * Python" (a.k.a. Cosmic Python) — see Chapter 2: Repository Pattern. The
 * intent is to decouple the domain layer from Eloquent so we can later
 * swap the persistence backend without touching service-layer code.
 *
 * Concrete subclasses are expected to bind themselves to a specific
 * Eloquent model and surface domain-meaningful query methods. None exist
 * yet — this base lives in the tree to set the convention for the team.
